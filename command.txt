Git Commnad:

git init --> initialized empty Git repository in specified repo.

git status --> command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. 
It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. 
Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.

git add . -->add all files/folders in current add to the git repository

git add [file/folder_name] --> add individual file in repository

git commit --> captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. 
Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a 
project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to

git commit -m 'messgae' --> -m stands for message which will appear after 
once file is saved

git restore --staged [file/folder_name] --> it will restore previous version of file

git log --> shows the commit history

git reset [hash_ID] --> it will restore the deleted file to state where it was deleted.

git stash --> Git stash is a built-in command with the distributed Version control tool in Git that 
locally stores all the most recent changes in a workspace and resets the state of the workspace to the prior commit state. 
A user can retrieve all files put into the stash with the git stash pop and git stash apply commands.

git stash clear --> This command enables you to look all stashed changes: git stash list. 
Here is the following command use it to clear all of your stashed changes:

git remote add origin [reposiotry_url_name] -->
1.Open .
2.Change the current working directory to your local project.
3.Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the git remote set-url command. 
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git.
4.Verify that the remote URL has changed.

git remote -v --> shows all URL attached to the folder/ current repository

git push orign master --> it will push the file into repository
